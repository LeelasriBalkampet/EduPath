# EduPath AI - Smart Learning Assistant for Personalized Education

EduPath is a web-based smart learning assistant designed to support personalized and continuous education.  
The system provides learning analytics, an interactive chat tutor, structured learning paths, and quiz-based assessment to help students identify weak areas and improve their learning outcomes.

The project is currently implemented **up to the design and frontend development phase**, with mock APIs simulating backend behavior.

## Objectives

- To design an AI-powered smart learning assistant
